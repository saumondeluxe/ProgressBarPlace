# Progress Bar Editor

Who's ever dreamed of <cr>editing</cr> the progress bar to their heart's content?
Nobody, but I decided to make a mod to do it anyway (btw it's my first mod, so be nice).

## Features
- Change the color of the progress bar
- Change the position of the progress bar
- Change the visibility of the progress bar
- Change the color of the progress bar label
- Change the position of the progress bar label
- Change the visibility of the progress bar label

## Warning
- **THIS MOD DOES NOT OVERRIDE THE LABEL COLOR IF YOU ARE USING THE "<cr>Golden Best</cr>" MOD**

## Usage
- On the pause menu, you have the litle `edit button`
